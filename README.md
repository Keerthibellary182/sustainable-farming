Problem Statement:
Plant Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Agriculture is a major contributor to the global economy, and healthy crop production is essential for food security. However, plants are often affected by various diseases that lead to reduced yield and economic loss. Traditional methods of disease detection rely on manual observation by farmers or experts, which is time-consuming, subjective, and often inaccurate.
To address this challenge, this project aims to develop an automated plant disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model will classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased, and if diseased, it will identify the type of disease based on visual symptoms in the leaf image.
By leveraging deep learning, the system can assist farmers and agricultural experts in early diagnosis, timely treatment, and sustainable crop management, ultimately promoting eco-friendly and resource-efficient farming.

 Objectives:
 
To collect and preprocess a dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaf images.
To design and train a CNN model that can classify plant leaf images into disease categories.
To evaluate the model’s accuracy and performance using appropriate metrics.
To develop a simple user interface or web app (optional) for real-time disease detection.
